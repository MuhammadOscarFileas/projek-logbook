## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Testing with Dummy Data

The application now uses dummy data for testing purposes. No backend server is required.

### Changing User Role for Testing

To test different dashboards, edit the role in `src/auth/AuthProvider.js`:

```javascript
const dummyUser = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  role: 'officer' // Change this to 'supervisor' or 'superadmin'
};
```

### Available Roles:
- `officer` - Access to Officer Dashboard
- `supervisor` - Access to Supervisor Dashboard  
- `superadmin` - Access to Super Admin Dashboard

### Dummy Data Included:
- **Log Books**: 5 sample log entries with different statuses
- **Activities**: 5 sample activities with various priorities
- **Reports**: 5 sample reports with different types and statuses
- **Dashboard Stats**: Realistic statistics for each role
- **User Activities**: Sample user activity logs
- **System Alerts**: Sample system notifications
